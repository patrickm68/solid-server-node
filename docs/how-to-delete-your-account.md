# How to delete your account

If you wish you delete your account at a multi-user pod provider that runs the node-solid-server software
(like currently https://solid.community and https://inrupt.net), you can do that as follows:

### Browse to your pod
Step 1 is to go to your pod with your web browser. In this example, the pod provider is https://solid.community
and the username is 'demo-account-deletion'. So in that case you would go to https://demo-account-deletion.solid.community/.

Make sure you include your username as a subdomain there, so not just https://solid.community/ which would be the
pod provider's main page, not your account / pod.
Fill in your own identity provider URL and insert your own username in there, just after the 'https://' part of the URL.

### Log in

When you click 'Log in', it will ask you (in a pop-up window) which identity provider to log in with; choose your own pod, in this example
'demo-account-deletion.solid.community'.

And fill in your username and password to log in:

The pop-up will close, and you will be logged in:

Fill in your account name and click 'Send Delete Account link'. Note that as a security measure, this requires you (still) have access to the email
address with which the account was created.
