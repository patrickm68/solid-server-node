# This example assumes, that you are running a jwilders/nginx proxy
# with certificate generation by a letsencrypt companion container
# as described here:
#
# https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion/blob/master/docs/Docker-Compose.md
#
# This should provide a docker volume containing the generated certificates.
# We will use the same cert and key as the webproxy for the actual solid server. While it seems to
# work, I am not sure if it is actually a good idea. Please file an issue if you want to discuss this.

# Adjust any line that is commented with (!):
# 1. Change any occurrence of the domain `solid.example` to your actual domain
# 2. Adjust the `latest` tag to a specific version you want to use.
